Bismark report for: /gscratch/srlab/sr320/data/cg/zr3534_1_R1.fastp-trim.20201202.fq.gz and /gscratch/srlab/sr320/data/cg/zr3534_1_R2.fastp-trim.20201202.fq.gz (version: v0.21.0)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /gscratch/srlab/sr320/data/Cgig-genome/roslin_M/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 -p 8 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	76522716
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	47127724
Mapping efficiency:	61.6% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	17253197
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	12141795
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	96

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
